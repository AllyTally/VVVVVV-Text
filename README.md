# VVVVVV Text
This program is a GUI interface which generates internal scripting VVVVVV textboxes depending on your input.

## Installation
Make sure you have `Python 3` installed.

This program requires `PyQt5` to be installed. Both methods of installation listed below install it automatically.

### Through git:
If you have `git` installed, you can follow these.

To install, type `pip3 install git+https://github.com/AllyTally/VVVVVV-Text#egg=vvvvvv-text` in your terminal.

To run the program, use `python3 -m vvvvvv-text` in your terminal. Feel free to create a batch/shell script that runs this command so it's easier to open.

If you are unable to use `pip3` or `python3`, try `pip` and `python`.

### Without git:
First, clone/download the repo, using the big green button above. Then run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

To run the program, run `python3 vvvvvv-text.py` in your terminal. Make sure you run this in the folder containing `vvvvvv-text.py`. Feel free to create a batch/shell script that runs this command so it's easier to open.

On Windows, it's possible to double-click the `vvvvvv-text.py` file to run the program in most cases.

If you are unable to use `pip3` or `python3`, try `pip` and `python`.
